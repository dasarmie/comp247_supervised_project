Fatal Collisions Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of fatal accidents using a machine learning model. The dataset includes various features related to accidents, and the goal is to build and evaluate models that can accurately classify whether an accident is fatal or not.

Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: This section involves loading and preparing the dataset for model training. It includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Various machine learning models are defined and trained on the dataset. These include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Model Evaluation: Models are evaluated using Grid Search to tune hyperparameters and assess their performance using classification metrics.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
imblearn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
Data
The dataset used in this project is Killed_and_Seriously_Injured.csv. Ensure this file is located in the specified path or update the path in the code accordingly.

Usage
Load Data:
The data is loaded and initially explored to understand its structure and missing values.

Preprocessing:

Missing values are handled by filling them with the mode of each column.
Features are separated into numeric and categorical columns.
Numeric features are scaled, and categorical features are one-hot encoded.
Model Definition:
Models are defined as follows:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Pipeline Creation:
Pipelines are created for each model, including SMOTE for handling class imbalance.

Grid Search:
Grid Search is used to tune hyperparameters for each model, and the best parameters are selected based on cross-validation performance.

Evaluation:

The best models are evaluated using classification reports, which include precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Code
Hereâ€™s a summary of the major sections in the code:

Loading and Exploring Data: Loads the dataset, explores basic statistics, and handles missing values.
Preprocessing: Defines and applies preprocessing steps for numeric and categorical features.
Model Training and Evaluation: Defines models, creates pipelines with SMOTE, performs Grid Search, and evaluates the best models.
Results
The evaluation of models yields the following results:

Logistic Regression:
Best parameters: {'classifier__C': 10, 'classifier__solver': 'liblinear'}
Accuracy: 96%
Decision Tree:
Best parameters: {'classifier__max_depth': 3, 'classifier__min_samples_leaf': 1, 'classifier__min_samples_split': 10}
Accuracy: 99%
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Best parameters: {'classifier__C': 6, 'classifier__gamma': 'scale', 'classifier__kernel': 'rbf', 'smote__k_neighbors': 3}
Accuracy: 98%
The Decision Tree model performed the best in terms of accuracy and class balance.
